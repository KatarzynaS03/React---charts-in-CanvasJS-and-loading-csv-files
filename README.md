# React---charts-in-CanvasJS-and-loading-csv-files
The application was created as part of completing the list 7 from the subject of Network Technologies - biomedical engineering, year III. The whole point was to create an application to display the emission levels carbon dioxide in New Zealand in 2007-2018. At the top of the page there is a button to load data from a csv file and a header informing about waiting for data. Each record consists of a region name (we analyze Auckland, Waikato and Wellington), the year and emission values in kilotons. In the component with the chart, split the data by region (Auckland, Waikato, and Wellington). At the very top of the component there is a section with buttons that will show / hide data series. The series is set to visible by default. When you press one from the buttons, the visibility of the data series and the button text change.
